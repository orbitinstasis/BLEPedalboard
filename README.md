Bluethooth BLE Pedalboard

How to build a Bluetooth Pedalboard. It is targeted to Yamaha ThrII amps, but can be adapted to work with any Midi Bluetooth devices.

The pedalboard has two modes that chan be changed by on of the buttons
Mode 0: Changes between the 5 stored pressets
Mode 1: Turns on/ff each of the 5 effects (Compressor, Nosise Gate, Modulation, Echo, Reverb)

The pedalboard needs to talk with the android App, this is an amp limitation.
